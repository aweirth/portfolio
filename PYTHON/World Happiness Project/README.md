# World Happiness Report Project

The following is a project I did with classmates Paul McSlarrow and Meelad Doroodchi. I was responsible for data cleaning and EDA for which I have included notebook files of the two steps.

- dataCleaning is my markdown file that took world happiness report data from 2015-2021 and merged each years data together after cleaning so we could use one dataframe for our project.
- happinessEDA is some basic visualization I did to explore correlations between variables and see how these relationships changed from 2015-2021. Also I explored some events such as the effect of Covid on hapiness scores.
