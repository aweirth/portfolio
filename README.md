# Coursework & Technical Skills Portfolio: Alex Weirth

<div>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Alex Weirth. I am currently a graduate student at Willamette University working towards my Master's of Data Science. I completed a Double Major Bachelor's of Science in Data Science and
      Enviormental Science in May 2023.
      <br><br>
      The following is my undergradute and graduate work and projects in python, R, and postgreSQL. My undergradute work has given me practical skills and thorough
      understanding of concepts in machine learning and modeling, data engineering, database management, data visualization, data communication, and
      statistics. I am continuing to strengthen my data science skills in graduate school and am eager to apply my skillset to a team in a professional role.
      <br><br>
      The repository is divided into 3 main folders for python, R, and postgreSQL with each containing examples of my work divided by concept or individual
      projects. I always invite constant feedback or ways to improve my work!
