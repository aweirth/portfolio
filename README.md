# Coursework & Technical Skills Portfolio: Alex Weirth

<div>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Alex Weirth. I am currently a student at Willamette University completing a Double Major Bachelor's of Science in Data Science and
      Enviormental Science in May 2023. I have also committed to pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science starting in Fall 2023 at Willamette University.
      <br><br>
      The following is my undergradute work and projects in python, R, and postgreSQL. My undergradute work has given me practical skills and thorough
      understanding of concepts in machine learning and modeling, data engineering, database management, data visualization, data communication, and
      statistics.
      <br><br>
      The repository is divided into 3 main folders for python, R, and postgreSQL with each containing examples of my work divided by concept or individual
      projects visualized in markdowns or PDF documents. I always invite constant feedback or ways to improve my work!
