# R Portfolio

### This folder contains coursework and projects using R Studio. The current bulk of this folder is my undergraduate projects in machine learning which I have divided into regression modeling, and classification modeling.

### My most recent graduate project was constructing a Shiny App Dashboard using PGA Tour golf data which I am passionate about from the 2021 Masters Tournament. The purpose was to better visualize PGA Tour data and create a dashboard that enhances the avid fan's experience. The dashboard can be seen [here](https://aweirth.shinyapps.io/shiny_masters/).
- App is hosted on Shinyapps.io but the code for the Shiny App can be seen in the App.R file.
