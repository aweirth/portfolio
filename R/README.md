# R Portfolio

### This folder contains coursework and projects using R Studio. The current contents of this folder are as follows:

- Undergraduate coursework in classification modeling.

- Undergraduate coursework in regression modeling.

- Graduate project constructing a Shiny App Dashboard using PGA Tour golf data which I am passionate about from the 2021 Masters Tournament. The purpose was to better visualize PGA Tour data and create a dashboard that enhances the avid fan's experience. The dashboard can be seen [here](https://aweirth.shinyapps.io/shiny_masters/). App is hosted on Shinyapps.io but the code for the Shiny App can be seen in the App.R file.

- Graduate final project given 72 hours to analyze a kickstarter dataset and compile a comprehensive report communicating insights to stakeholders in the data. The data covered historical kickstarter campaigns and the report communicates my findings and reccomendations for stakeholders in the kickstarter platform. Link to PDF report is in the "Kickstarter Data Analysis Report" folder.
